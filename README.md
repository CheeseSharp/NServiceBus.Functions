# NServiceBus.Functions
This is a sample project that demonstrates integration between self-hoted NServiceBus endpoint and Azure Functions. In this setup the function acts as a handler for `PingCommand`s send from the `Sender` endpoint that responds with `PongReply`.

The functions has the following signatrue:

```csharp
public static void Run([NServiceBusTrigger(QueueName = "main-queue")]PingCommand command, NServiceBusCollector collector, TraceWriter log)
```

It's tiggered via `NServiceBusTrigger` running on top of ASQ transport that passes the input POCO command. The second arguemnt `NServiceBusCollector` handles messages generated by the function on execution.
